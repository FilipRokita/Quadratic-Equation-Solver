# Quadratic Equation Solver

The Quadratic Equation Solver is a simple console application that can solve quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. It prompts the user to input the values of a, b, and c, and then calculates and displays the values of x1 and x2.

## How to Use

1. Run the program by compiling and executing the `quadratic_equation_solver.cpp` file in your preferred C++ development environment.
2. When prompted, enter the values of a, b, and c for your quadratic equation.
3. The program will then calculate and display the values of x1 and x2, if they exist.
4. Press any key to continue and solve another quadratic equation.

## Requirements

- C++ development environment (e.g. Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, etc.)

## Notes

- If the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is less than zero, the program will display a message indicating that the equation has no real roots.

I hope you find this program useful!
